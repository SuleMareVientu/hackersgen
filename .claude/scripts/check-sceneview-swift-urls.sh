# check-sceneview-swift-urls.sh — block PRs that reintroduce references to the
# archived `sceneview/sceneview-swift` SPM mirror.
#
# The `sceneview/sceneview-swift` mirror was retired in PR #1215: SPM consumers
# now resolve `SceneViewSwift` directly from the monorepo root `Package.swift`.
# The mirror repo is archived read-only. Any NEW occurrence of the
# `sceneview-swift` URL in docs / config / samples / generated bundles is a
# bug — a stale paste from old docs or an AI-suggestion regression — and would
# point users at a dead resolution path.
#
# This gate greps the tracked tree for `sceneview-swift` and fails on any hit
# outside the historical / attribution allowlist below.
#
# ── Extending the allowlist ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# If a NEW file legitimately needs a historical `sceneview-swift` mention
# (e.g. a future changelog entry, a migration note, an attribution comment),
# add its exact repo-root-relative path to the ALLOW regex below in the same
# commit. Each allowed file is there for a documented reason:
#   - Package.swift                       — comment explaining the monorepo SPM root
#   - .github/workflows/release.yml       — comment about the retired mirror
#   - CLAUDE.md                           — historical changelog narrative
#   - SceneViewSwift/.../SceneView.swift   — "Ported from ... sceneview-swift PR #1" attribution
#   - CHANGELOG.md                        — historical version entries (mirror retirement)
#   - docs/docs/migration.md              — migration guide quoting the old mirror URL
#   - .claude/scripts/check-sceneview-swift-urls.sh — this detector itself
#   - .github/workflows/ci.yml            — the repo-hygiene job comment that documents this detector
#
# Usage:
#   bash .claude/scripts/check-sceneview-swift-urls.sh
#
# Exit code: 0 if clean, 1 if a non-allowlisted reference is found.
#
# Closes #1237.
